# This repo stores my common settings of tools.

## Emacs

To install ensime for Emacs support, refer to
http://ensime.github.io/editors/emacs/install/. Specifically, you need to setup
MELPA following http://ensime.github.io/editors/emacs/learning/.

To install ensime for sbt, follow http://ensime.github.io/build_tools/sbt/. This
allows sbt to build .ensime for your project.

Once .ensime is created for the project, you can start emacs, and 'M-x ensime'
to start/connect to the server.

## Bash

## Zsh
